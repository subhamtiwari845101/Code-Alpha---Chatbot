## 📝 Project Overview

This chatbot responds to specific predefined messages entered by the user.  
It continues running until the user types **"bye"**, after which the program exits.

It handles simple inputs such as:

| User Input       | Chatbot Response       |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| `hello`          | `Hi!`                   |
| `how are you`    | `I'm fine, thanks!`     |
| `bye`            | `Goodbye!`              |

If the user enters something else, the bot replies with:  
👉 *"Sorry, I don't understand that."*
